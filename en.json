      "title": "What is the Pomodoro Technique?",
      "p1": "The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.",
      "p2": "These intervals are known as 'pomodoros', the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.",
      "p3": "The technique has 5 basic steps: 1. Decide on the task to be done. 2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes). 3. Work on the task. 4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5 minutes). 5. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (typically 15–30 minutes).",
      "p4": "The main goal of this method is to reduce the impact of internal and external interruptions on focus and flow. By breaking down large tasks and scheduling regular breaks, it helps improve concentration and prevent mental fatigue."
